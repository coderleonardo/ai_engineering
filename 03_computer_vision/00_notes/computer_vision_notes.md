## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data from the world. It involves the development of algorithms and models that can process, analyze, and understand images and videos, mimicking the human visual system. Applications of computer vision include image recognition, object detection, and video analysis.

## Computer Vision Applications

Deep learning models such as CNNs can be applied to:

- Object Detection and Recognition: For example, identifying and classifying objects in images for autonomous vehicles.
  
- Facial Recognition: For example, unlocking smartphones using facial features.

- Real-Time Video Analytics: For example, monitoring traffic flow and detecting accidents in real-time.

- Image and Video Enhancement: For example, improving the quality of low-resolution images and videos.

- Robotic Vision: For example, enabling robots to navigate and interact with their environment.

- Medical Applications: For example, analyzing medical images to detect diseases such as cancer.

- Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR): For example, overlaying digital information onto the real world for enhanced user experiences.

## Brief History of Artificial Intelligence

- **1950**: Alan Turing proposes the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence.
- **1956**: The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined by John McCarthy during the Dartmouth Conference.
- **1966**: ELIZA, an early natural language processing computer program, is created by Joseph Weizenbaum.
- **1970s**: AI research faces a period known as the "AI Winter" due to reduced funding and interest.
- **1980s**: Expert systems, which mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert, become popular.

## How does a computer see?

The computer decomposes the image into pixels, each with a specific value, forming a matrix that corresponds to the shape of the image.

In the image above, you can see how an image is broken down into individual pixels. Each pixel has a specific color value, and together they form the complete image. This matrix of pixels is what the computer processes to understand and interpret the visual data.

## How does a computer process videos?

Videos are essentially a sequence of images (frames) displayed in rapid succession to create the illusion of motion. Each frame is processed similarly to how individual images are processed, but with additional considerations for the temporal aspect of the data.

### Steps in Video Processing:

1. **Frame Extraction**: The video is broken down into individual frames. Each frame is an image that can be processed independently.

2. **Preprocessing**: Frames may undergo preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and noise reduction to enhance the quality and consistency of the data.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from each frame to identify important elements such as edges, textures, and motion vectors.

4. **Object Detection and Tracking**: Objects within the frames are detected and tracked across multiple frames to understand their movement and interactions over time.

5. **Temporal Analysis**: The sequence of frames is analyzed to capture temporal patterns and relationships. This can involve techniques like optical flow to measure motion between frames.

6. **Action Recognition**: The temporal data is used to recognize actions and events occurring in the video, such as identifying specific activities or behaviors.

### Applications of Video Processing:

- **Surveillance Systems**: Monitoring and analyzing video feeds for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions or suspicious activities.

- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Processing video data from cameras to navigate and make decisions in real-time.

- **Sports Analytics**: Analyzing game footage to provide insights into player performance and strategies.

- **Healthcare**: Monitoring patients and analyzing medical procedures through video data.

- **Entertainment**: Enhancing video quality, adding special effects, and enabling interactive experiences in movies and games.

### Video Quality Metrics:

- **Frames Per Second (FPS)**: The number of frames displayed per second. Higher FPS results in smoother motion but requires more processing power and storage.

- **Resolution**: The dimensions of the video in pixels (e.g., 1920x1080 for Full HD). Higher resolution provides more detail but increases the computational load.

- **Bitrate**: The amount of data processed per second of video, typically measured in Mbps (megabits per second). Higher bitrate improves video quality but requires more bandwidth and storage.

By processing videos, computers can gain a deeper understanding of dynamic scenes and make informed decisions based on the temporal context of the visual data.
